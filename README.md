# Coffee Reviews Analysis and Model Training Dashboard using Streamlit  

This Streamlit dashboard is designed to analyze and model a comprehensive coffee dataset that includes details on coffee name, type, origin, and descriptive reviews. The project focuses on **data preprocessing** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to reveal key insights, which serve as the foundation for various machine learning models to **predict prices, analyze sentiment in reviews, provide coffee recommendations**, and **group similar coffees**. This project focuses on predicting coffee prices, analyzing sentiment in reviews, providing coffee recommendations, and clustering coffees based on key characteristics.

### Project Pages and Features
1. `Dataset` â€“ A preview of the Coffee Reviews Dataset, the dataset used for this project. 
2. `Data Pre-processing` â€“ Processing the data by removing nulls, duplicates, and outliers, tokenizing text data, and encoding object columns.
3. `EDA` â€“ An Exploratory Data Analysis that focuses on data distribution and correlation of variables tailored for the models we aim to develop. These are visualized through pie charts, word clouds, histograms, and bar charts.
4. `Coffee Price Prediction Model` â€“ A model that uses Random Forest Regressor to predict coffee prices based on categorical data.
5. `Sentiment Intensity Analysis Model` â€“ A model that uses Random Forest Regressor to predict ratings based on coffee descriptions.
6. `Coffee Recommendation Model` â€“ A model that uses TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity to curate coffee recommendations based on similar descriptions.
7. `Coffee Clustering Model` â€“ A model that uses K-means to group coffees based on price and rating patterns.
8. `Conclusion` â€“ Contains a summary of the processes and insights gained from the previous steps.
