# Sreamlit Dashboard Template

![Main Page Screenshot](screenshots/main_page_screenshot.png)

This repository serves as a project guide template for my students in **Introduction to Data Science** course for their final project. It contains a Python file `dashboard_template.py` which contains a boilerplate for a Streamlit dashboard.

# Coffee Reviews Analysis and Model Training Dashboard using Streamlit   

This Streamlit dashboard explores a dataset about coffee, which includes information about its name, type, and origins, as well as descriptive reviews. To analyze the data, **Data-preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** are conducted to gain insights, which are then used to train Machine Learning Models to **predict coffee prices, predict ratings based on descriptions, curate coffee recommendations**, and **group them based on similar characteristics**.

### 📖 Pages:
1. `Dataset` – A preview of the Coffee Reviews Dataset, the dataset used for this project. 
2. `Data Pre-processing` – Processing the data by removing nulls, duplicates, and outliers, tokenizing text data, and encoding object columns.
3. `EDA` – An Exploratory Data Analysis that focuses on data distribution and correlation of variables tailored for the models we aim to develop. These are visualized through pie charts, word clouds, histograms, and bar charts.
4. `Coffee Price Prediction Model` – A model that uses Random Forest Regressor to predict coffee prices based on categorical data.
5. `Sentiment Intensity Analysis Model` – A model that uses Random Forest Regressor to predict ratings based on coffee descriptions.
6. `Coffee Recommendation Model` – A model that uses TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity to curate coffee recommendations based on similar descriptions.
7. `Coffee Clustering Model` – A model that uses K-means to group coffees based on price and rating patterns.
8. `Conclusion` – Contains a summary of the processes and insights gained from the previous steps.
