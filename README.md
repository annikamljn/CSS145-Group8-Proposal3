# Coffee Reviews Analysis and Model Training Dashboard using Streamlit  

This Streamlit dashboard is designed to analyze and model a comprehensive coffee dataset that includes details on coffee name, type, origin, and descriptive reviews. The project focuses on **data preprocessing** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to reveal key insights, which serve as the foundation for various machine learning models to **predict prices, analyze sentiment in reviews, provide coffee recommendations**, and **group similar coffees**.
